TODO list for Perl module WWW::PDAScraper

    The user-agent should really be part of the object, I guess. That would
    be neater.

    And it should actually use WWW::Robot instead of LWP so it doesn't
    hammer servers.

    And we could either add arbitrary numbers of regexes for fixing up the
    pages of sites which don't have a print-friendly version of the page, or
    add a second level of parsing to find the print-friendly link, for sites
    which don't have a logical relationship between the regular link and the
    print-friendly.
